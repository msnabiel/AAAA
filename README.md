## Customization

### Changing the Background

To customize the background, you can replace the current image with your own. Ensure that the background setting is transparent to see the changes clearly. Here's how to do it:

1. **Replace the image**:

   Place your new background image in the `public` folder.

2. **Update the CSS**:

   Modify the CSS to ensure the background is set to transparent or the new image:
   Here's an example on how you can do it.

   ```css
   /* Example: src/App.css */
   body {
     background: transparent url('./public/your-background-image.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
     background-size: cover;
   }
   ```

4. **Make sure the code allows for transparency**:

   Verify that the background property in the code is set to transparent to allow for visible changes.
